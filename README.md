## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Tailwind CSS(v4+)](https://tailwindcss.com/) - for styles <3
- JavaScript

### What I learned

I didn't quite learn it, but I understood the concept of `fetch` with **JSON**.

I discovered the convenience of Tailwind's `color/alpha` syntax (e.g., `bg-red-500/70`) for managing transparency without affecting child elements.

**Tooltip Implementation:** Initially attempted using `::after` pseudo-element, but encountered opacity inheritance issues when the parent element's opacity changed. I overcomplicated the solution by creating a separate DOM element for the tooltip. In hindsight, using `rgba()` for the parent's background instead of `opacity` would have been cleaner and allowed the `::after` pseudo-element to work independently. Lesson learned: reserve separate tooltip elements for cases where both `::before` and `::after` are already occupied! ðŸ˜…

### Continued development

- Better understanding of CSS `opacity` vs `rgba()` for transparency control
- When to use pseudo-elements vs separate DOM elements
